Mutants killed already at level 1 i.e List of mutants that have crashes or OBEs on all 20 model thus definitely has introduced a faulty behaviour: 0 mutants

analysing further on remaining mutants i.e mutants having crashes or OBEs on some models,mutants not having crashes or OBEs: 10
mutants killed on statistical killing approach: 10
mutants not killed on statistical killing approach: 0


Information on Comparison between model-level and system-level killing
% : mutant is killed on both model level and system level killing: 20.00
% : mutant is not killed on both model level and system level killing: 0.0

Information on metrics
Metrics which kills high number of mutants: ['Std(Acc)']
The rank 1 metrics which kills mutations when all the other metrics can not kill it: ['Std(Speed)', 'Max(Acc)', 'Mean(SA)', 'Mean(SAS)', 'Std(SAS)', 'Std(LS)', 'Max(Speed)', 'Min(Acc)', 'Std(Acc)', 'Mean(TPP)']

killing ability percentages: 
Model level killing(on remaining mutants not killed from Crashes/OBEs): 0.20
Killed if crashes/OBEs on all model: 0.00
Killed by statistical killing definition(on remaining mutants not killed from Crashes/OBEs): 1.00
